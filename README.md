# cricket-layouts

Layouts used for cricket matches. These are not used in any production and were made for fun. Some of the [gdx18-layouts](https://github.com/gamesdonequick/gdqx18-layouts) (e.g. tsconfig files) may be seen as it currently is the only large TypeScript bundle so I'm using to assist my learning.
